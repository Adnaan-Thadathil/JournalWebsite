# JournalWebsite
# Simple journal website being made in progress.
I want to learn all the thing to make my own website and learn the process needed to do this project. I wanted to learn about how to publish a website, leanr how to use reactjs, how to use git functionally, how to incorporate html,vcss, and javascript to make a website, adn eventually learn how to do a proper backend for the website. The next step for this project would be to learn how t adapt this to a mobile app.
To do this, I was going to work on this project everyday and show progress of my wokr through github. I decided to use Deepseek in order to learn each of the goals described above using it. However, I decided to place some rules with using the AI. I would only use the AI to guide me through the process and to give me tips when I feel stuck. I would not have it generate any code for me. This I woild be able ot learn and adapt on the fly for understanding how to solve problems while pursuing teh goals for this project.
# Day 1:
I first started coding and started with a simple html layout. I started to then look at how I wanted the design to be. I wanted the website to act like a real journal. So I decided to design the website so that it would look like that. I used divs to organize and divide each of the sectiosn required to showcase this look. Such as the front cover, spine, pages, and the back cover. I then created the css file for this. I then asked deepseek for some options to use for designing the journal look for the divs. I then incorporated these. I also made a simple design wireframe and can be found in the images folder. The wireframe will need more additions, however, I wanted to make somehting simple for now. I also made a cover image that i found online that was free and edited for my use. This img file is called cover.png and the original file is cover.jpg, found in the images folder.
